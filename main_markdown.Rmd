# A01: Introduction

Honolulu is the capital city of the state of Hawaii. The city’s name means ‘sheltered bay’ in the Hawaiian language and today is home to over 390,000 people. The urban city of Honolulu extends about 10 miles along the southeastern shore of Oahu and four miles inland into the foothills of the Koolau Range. The city-county comprises all of Oahu and some outlying islets, which have an aggregate land area of only three square miles but extend for more than 1,300 miles when accounting for ocean.  

Some fun facts about the city include: 

* Barack Obama was born in Honolulu 
* Honolulu is home to the only royal palace in the US 
* Honolulu sees 90 days of rain per year 
* One of the deadliest attacks on the US (Pearl Harbor) took place in Honolulu 
* It is one of the most expensive places to live in the US 

Understanding the demographics and economies of the city will help us form assumptions about travel behavior as we construct our model. According to the US Census Bureau, 21% of Honolulu’s population is under the age of 18, and 18% are over 65. The average household size is 2.96. The racial makeup of the city is 21.3% White, 2.7% Black, 42.1% Asian, 10% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 10% Hispanic or Latino, and 23% identifying as two or more races. The median household income is $92,600. Key industries are international trade logistics (given its location between the East and West), military defense (for the same geographical reason), research and development, and manufacturing.1 

When looking at Honolulu and the greater island of Oahu, we made some interesting observations related to transportation. Firstly, city growth is heavily constrained by surrounding geography. The island is made up of two major mountain ranges hosting several extinct volcanoes: The Waiʻanae range to the west, and Koʻolau range to the east. These mountain ranges cause most of the island to be unfit for development due to the steep terrain. A map of streets on Oahu reveals that there are very few connections through or over the mountain ranges. Sandwiched between the coastline and the mountains, Honolulu has little room for growth and must maximize infrastructure investments.

# A03: Road network skim

## Workflow

For our assignment 3 workflow, we generally followed the guidelines and assumptions set forth in the series of tutorials, as these made sense in the context of Honolulu. This was true for setting vehicle speed by road type, filtering the road types to be included in the network (with the exception that we also included Type = ‘primary’ in our model) and the steps for deleting orphan roads. As we ran through the process of troubleshooting our skims, however, we did make some assumptions that deviated from the example workflow, which are described in the following sections.

## One-way roads

The most substantial issue we faced was traffic analysis zones showing up as disconnected from the rest of the network due to one-way streets. We investigated dozens of these supposed one-way streets on Google Earth, and discovered that the vast majority were mislabeled and actually accommodate vehicles in both directions. We ran several selection formulas to change these streets to two-way roads. We also noticed that where some actual one-way streets existed as the primary connector for a TAZ, the skim showed that zone as disconnected from the rest of the network, either because there was a supposed travel lane entering the TAZ but no way to exit, or vice versa. Our investigation found that in these cases, much of the local road network had been filtered out as residential roads and were not included in the model, so where in reality a driver would be easily able to take similar one-way streets to enter and exit a TAZ, only one street would be factored into the model. In some cases, we deleted these one-way roads and recalculated the centroid connectors to find the nearest two-way street, but for the remainder, we found it appropriate to change the designation of the roads to two-way streets, as we assume that this is a better estimation of actual travel time.
